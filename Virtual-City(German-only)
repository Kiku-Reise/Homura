info "This game was developed by G5 Entertainment for the PC and later removed from the market. (Probably to make money on the cell phone with the pay2win version - who knows). This is probably the last copy of the german version of my old HDD when I was a kid. This is not an intentional breaking of copyrights, a good old game like this should simply not disappear."
